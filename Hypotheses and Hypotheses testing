Analysis of Outerwear Department Underperformance
​1. Research Hypotheses
​The primary objective of this study is to determine why the outerwear department is underperforming. The central null hypothesis (H_0) suggests that the underperformance is due to a low experience memory making rating. To explore this further, several alternative hypotheses have been developed:
​Perceived Value (H_{1a}): The perceived value has decreased, potentially due to factors like material quality or the level of service provided. This is measured via user ratings and the average purchase revenue.
​Discount Penetration (H_{1b}): High discount penetration has negatively impacted the performance of the e-commerce retailer.
​Seasonality (H_{1c}): Underperformance may be tied to seasonal trends. This is analyzed by looking at total revenue across all seasons (specifically January through February).
​Product Variety (H_{1d}): There may be a lack of variety for the customer mix of the retailer across all generations.
​Promotional Strategy (H_{1e}): Performance could be hindered by a lack of effective promotions tailored to different age groups.
​2. Testing Hypotheses with Metrics
​To validate or refute the hypotheses mentioned above, specific performance metrics and data points were analyzed.
​Perceived Value and Quality
​Contrary to the initial hypothesis, the perceived value of the product does not appear to be the primary driver of underperformance. Data shows a 0% return rate and a steady rating, indicating that customers still perceive the product as high value and are satisfied with the quality they receive.
​Discounting and Revenue
​The data indicates that discount penetration is lower compared to other categories. This lower level of discounting contributes to the underperformance in revenue when compared directly to other more aggressively discounted departments.
​Seasonal Impacts
​Seasonality plays a significant role in the outerwear department's lifecycle. While there is a definitive increase in sales during the Autumn and Winter months, there is a sharp and expected decline during Spring and Summer. The underperformance is most visible when looking at the year-round revenue totals versus more "season-less" categories.
​Assortment and Segmentation
​The underperformance is also attributed to a lack of variety and segmentation. Specifically, the lack of "bundle" promotions in the outerwear category results in a smaller basket size. When customers are not incentivized to purchase multiple items or coordinated sets, the total revenue per transaction remains lower than in other categories.
​3. Conclusion
​Based on the metrics, the null hypothesis (H_0) is rejected. The outerwear department is not underperforming due to low experience memory. Instead, the underperformance is primarily driven by lower discount penetration and a lack of bundle promotions, which results in smaller average basket sizes compared to other departments.
