# Outerwear Department Performance Analysis

## What This Analysis Is About

This analysis investigates why the outerwear department is underperforming compared to other product categories in an e-commerce retail environment. Although loyal customers continue to purchase outerwear and product quality remains high, overall revenue and profitability lag behind other departments. The study evaluates whether the issue is driven by customer experience, perceived value, discounting practices, seasonality, or promotional strategy.

## Key Findings

* **Customer experience and perceived value are not the problem:** Product ratings are stable and return rates are 0%, indicating strong satisfaction and quality.
* **Lower discount penetration impacts revenue:** Outerwear receives fewer discounts than other departments, which contributes to lower sales volumes in comparison.
* **Strong seasonality affects performance:** Sales peak in Autumn and Winter but decline sharply in Spring and Summer, reducing annual revenue totals.
* **Lack of bundle promotions limits basket size:** The absence of bundled or coordinated product offers results in smaller average transaction values.

## Summary Conclusion

The analysis shows that the outerwear department’s underperformance is primarily driven by seasonality, conservative discounting, and limited promotional bundling rather than poor customer experience or low perceived value. Addressing these areas presents an opportunity to improve revenue while maintaining long-term profitability.
